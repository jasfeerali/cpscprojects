Q: Can  you  create  a TimeInterface array  that  contains  a  mixture  
   of version1c.Time and version2c.Time objects 

A: Not the way i did it but I suspect that if I aranged my pakaged difrently Then I could 
   do it if I had one TimeInterface that all of the versions used buy since I have a time 
   interface foreac version it doesent work

   
Q: What happens with code like :
    TimeInterface ti = new version2c.Time(12,30,0) ;
    System.out.println(ti.getSec()) ;
    
A: The program will just print the seconds.


Q: What happens with code like :
    TimeInterface ti = new version2c.Time(12,30,0) ;
    ti.setSec(12) ;
    System.out.println(ti.getSec()) ;

A: It doesn't compile because timeInterface doesn't have a setSec() method.


Q: What happens with code like :
    TimeInterface ti = new version2c.Time(12,30,0) ;
    System.out.println(ti) ;
    
A: It prints out the output of the toString method in the time class,  Since it is a time object which has
   a toString method it uses that to print instead of its hex address. This is because all objects extend Object
   which has a toString method in it.

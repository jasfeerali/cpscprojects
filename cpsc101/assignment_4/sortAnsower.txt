Q: Why does adding "implements Comparable<Time>"
   make Arrays.sort work?
   
A: Because Arrays.sort uses Comparable in order to sort the objects.
   It does this by casting the object you wish to sort to a Comparable object.
   with version1/2 this cannot happen because Java doesn't know that the compareTo 
   method which our Time classes have is the same as the compareTo method promised 
   by Comparable because of that it give us an error (ClassCastException).  When
   we make our Time classes use the Comparable interface Java is then able to cast
   our Time objects to Comparable ones.

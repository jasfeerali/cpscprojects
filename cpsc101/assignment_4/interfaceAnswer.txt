Q: Why does "TimeInterface ti = new version1.Time(12,30,0);" 
   not work unless Time implements TimeInterface
   
A: Because Java doesn't know that Time can implement TimeInterface 
   until we tell it.  As far as Java is concerned they re completely different 
   classes with nothing in common until we tell it.

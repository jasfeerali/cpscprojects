Q: Why does "TimeInterface ti = new version1.Time(12,30,0);" 
   not work unless Time implements TimeInterface
   
A: Because Java dosent know that Time can implement TimeInterface 
   unitll we tell it.  As far as java is concened they re compleatly diffrent 
   classes with nothing in comen untill we tell it.
